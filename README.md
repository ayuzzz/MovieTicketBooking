<h4>Application Overview</h4>

This a Movie Ticket Booking application which completely follows the microservice architecture, i.e, each service is self sustained and has a connection to a common database(MySQL 5.6). The application is built using pythons's Flask Framework and each microservice is containerized using Docker.

<h4>Branches Overview</h4>

-> <b>docker</b> : It contains the dockerized version of app (dockerfiles present inside each microservice directory). I will be        attaching the powershell script for building and running each container.
