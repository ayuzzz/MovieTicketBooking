<h3>Application Overview</h3>

This a Movie Ticket Booking application which completely follows the microservice architecture, i.e, each service is self sustained and has a connection to a common database(MySQL 5.6). The application is built using pythons's Flask Framework and each microservice is containerized using Docker.

<h3>Branch Details</h3>

-> <b>master</b> : It contains the basic web app<br>
-> <b>docker</b> : It contains the dockerized version of app (dockerfiles present inside each microservice directory). I will be attaching the powershell script for building and running each container. (docker image details shared in the Readme.md of <b>docker</b> branch)
